### Design Rationale:

The census data I chose to visualize is comprised of age population of male and feamle within the United States. The age population data in the dataset represents the number of population for ages from 0 to 90 on 1900 and 2000 respectively. By looking at the raw data, I naturally got curious about how the population changed over time and if the changes of population for each ages differ from each other. Thereby, I chose to implement a line graph to maximize the visual effect of reduction and elevation of population for each ages. 

To effectively visualize the dataset, I first divided it up into 4 groups: age population of male in 1900, and 2000 and same for the female. After dividing, I have implemented 4 lines on the graph withy-axis being the population in millions and x-axis being the ages from 0 to 90 in 5 year intervals to represent each group. To simplify the numbers, I normalized the numbers to represent millions. In other words, the numbers in y-axis is scaled to millions. The colors of the graphs are purposefully chosen to represent the sex.Shades of blue are picked to portray that the lines belong to male population and similarly for female population, shades of pink were chosen.
    
One potential obscurity of my data visualiztion could come from the generalization of line graphs. Majority of the line graphs are used to depict changes over time. Although it is useful to portray progressive changes, the biggest strength of line graphs comes from visualizing the ups and downs. Moreover, it is a great fit to locate the peaks and troughs which can better resolve my curiosity. To use my visualization as an example, the age population for male and female on 1900 continuously decrease as age goes up. However, I can easily identify the huge surge of population for both male and female of age 30 and an unnatural peak for female population of age 75 on 2000. Those peaks and following troughs can be an interesting topic to research for and show that the line graphs are effective when visualizing such data.
